Project Description: Create a basic e-commerce website with an admin panel to manage product inventory using SQL or MySQL for the database. The admin should have full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
to manage product details,
including product name, 
description,
price, 
and images.

The website should have a user-friendly frontend where customers can browse products in a well-organized layout.

Requirements:
API: Use FastAPI (preferred) or a RESTful API.
Database: SQL or MySQL for storing product data.
Frontend: Use React JS (preferred), Next JS, or Django for building the user interface.
Styling: Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
Admin Panel: Allow admins to:
Add new products
Edit existing product details
Remove products from the inventory
Deployment: After completing the assignment:
Submit the project via a GitHub repository, including a detailed README file with setup instructions and screenshots of the admin panel and product pages.
Deploy the application on a free cloud hosting service such as Vercel, Netlify, Render, or any other free platform.
